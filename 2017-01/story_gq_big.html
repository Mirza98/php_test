    <p>SEATTLEITES GOT A serious scare on Friday evening when an airport employee stole a large turboprop airplane owned by the Alaska Air Group from the area’s Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, and took it for an unauthorized flight. The incident ended when the empty 76-seater Q400 Bombardier airplane crashed on a small island 25 miles to the south of the airport, killing the unsanctioned pilot—but only after an hour of confusion in Seattle, as flights were grounded, air traffic control tried to persuade the man to land the plane, and F-15 fighter jets scrambled out of nearby Portland, Oregon. No other injuries have been reported.</p>

    <p>In a statement, Alaska Airlines says the Federal Aviation Administration, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the National Transportation Safety Board are all investigating.</p>

    <p>The Pierce County Sheriff’s Department identified the deceased employee as a 29-year-old male ground service agent, but did not release his name. Radio chatter with air traffic control indicates—but does not confirm—that the man was suicidal. The employee worked for Horizon Air, a regional airline that is owned by the Alaska Air Group. According to the North American Aerospace Defense Command, the fighter jets did not fire on the airplane. And flights resumed in Seattle around an hour after the rogue employee took off from the airport.</p>

    <p>The Pierce County Sheriff’s Department identified the deceased employee as a 29-year-old male ground service agent, but did not release his name. Radio chatter with air traffic control indicates—but does not confirm—that the man was suicidal. The employee worked for Horizon Air, a regional airline that is owned by the Alaska Air Group. According to the North American Aerospace Defense Command, the fighter jets did not fire on the airplane. And flights resumed in Seattle around an hour after the rogue employee took off from the airport.</p>

    <p>A large part of the investigation will focus on how the man was able to just take a plane. If he was an authorized employee of an airline, it wouldn’t have been that difficult to get on the plane itself. It’s not that the area around an airplane’s ramp is a free-for-all, says Douglas M. Moss, who was a commercial pilot for 20 years and now runs AeroPacific Consulting, an aviation accident investigation agency. Each employee allowed in this sensitive area—baggage handlers, maintenance workers, flight attendants, and pilots—goes through background checks. Employees are also trained to ask others about what they’re doing in the area. “Everyone has a duty to approach someone or address them if they see someone in a place they shouldn’t be,” says Moss, noting that he had been asked to display his badge multiple times in the area while working as a pilot.</p>

    <p>But there are few official mechanisms restricting authorized employees from the airplane. “Everyone’s on an equal par,” says Moss. “Pilots or baggage loaders, they have the same sort of access.”</p>
